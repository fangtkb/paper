We thank the referee for useful comments and a positive assessment of our
paper. We have revised the manuscript according to the referee's comments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. In the introduction, the authors say that TDHFB trajectories are
classical.  I would argue that they are semi-classical as one need
to go to the second order beyond the SPA to recover the Fock term
according to Levit, PRC 1980.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We have replaced words "classical limit" by "stationary-phase limit"
in the introduction.

In the papers [28,29,30] by Negele, Levit, and coworkers, the
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation of a particular choice was
adopted, which leads to the path integral over the auxiliary fields.
This is why the SPA corresponds to the Hartree approximation. In the
present manuscript, we use the coherent-state representation for the
path integral form of Eq. (III,1), similar to Refs.[31,32,39]. In this
case, the Fock term is included in the SPA level. This is somewhat in
details, and we think that it is not suitable for the introduction.
Instead, we have added a footnote in Sec. III A, as
"In this formulation, the stationary-phase approximation agrees with
the TDHF(B) trajectories, while that to the auxiliary-field path
integral of Refs. [28,29] leads to the TDH(B) without the Fock potentials."

2. The potential application to fission is a bit of a stretch.
There are other problems with mean-field description of fission
such as changing occupation number when single-particles cross
(pairing may only partially help, see Blocki, Flocard, NPA 1976).
---------------------------------------------------------------
We agree with the referee that there are many problems to be solved,
before the realistic application to the spontaneous fission phenomena.
We have modified a sentence in the introduction as 
"... and possibly enables us to describe large-amplitude collective
tunneling phenomena such as spontaneous fission."
-->
"... and possibly enables us to describe large-amplitude collective
tunneling phenomena."

---------------------------------------------------------------
3. The introduction would benefit to a more exhaustive discussion of
the literature on QRPA and TDHFB studies of (pairing and normal)
vibrations as the main motivation is to improve these approaches.
---------------------------------------------------------------
According to the referee's suggestion, we have extended the second
paragraph of the introduction.

In addition, we have added references, corrected several trivial
mistakes, and made minor revisions from the previous manuscript.

We hope that the revised manuscript is now acceptable for publication.
